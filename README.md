# LearningDart
Core Dart functionalities I Explored and practiced while I learned how to code with Dart in 3 days (2 hours each day). Uncomment the lines of code that you're interested in and try tweaking and get a hand of it.

###### I explored:

- Data types
- Classes
- Getters and Setters
- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- Functional Programming concepts (Lambda expressions & functions, Higher-order functions, Closures)
- Data Collections (Fixed Length List, Growable List, Sets, and HashMaps)


## Practice with the online Dart tool (Dart Pad): https://dartpad.dev/
